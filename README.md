Cranberry is a WebSocket EventMachine-based server, that takes JSON strings as instructions.

This is not production ready, and still a work in progress. Check back soon!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cranberry'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cranberry

## Usage

To use run:

    bin/cranberry


to use the front-end client-side interface, open ``public/index.html``

## Concepts

### The grid

The grid has a width and height, and contains a set of cells. Each cell can have up to three walls, but not four - as four walls would make it inaccessible.

## Roadmap

0.0.1 stable

- [ ] build up spec coverage
- [ ] implement a command router for the Websocket onmessage events
- [ ] experiment with a DSL for other projects to use the gem with


1.0.0

- [ ] make it awesome
